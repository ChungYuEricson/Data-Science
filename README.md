### [Analyzing Jeopardy Data Using Chi-Squared Test](https://github.com/ChungYuEricson/ChungYuEricson-Portfolio/blob/main/JEOPARDY/Jeopardy.ipynb)

Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. It's been running for many years, and is a major force in popular culture. In each game, contestants are presented trivia clues phrased as answers, to which they must respond in the form of a question that correctly identifies whatever the clue is describing. This project aims to find out if there are any patterns that would lead to a better chance of winning.
